# code-cafe
The Code Café is a series of low key, relaxed meetups where we explore various technologies, tools, programming aids and other fun stuff in a relaxed setting. This repository contains artifacts for the Code Café sessions.

Note: in the Code Café, we can work with various technologies - browser based or local (typically in containers) - and across the stack: UI, (micro)service, database, code editing and programming utilities and general productivity boosters.
