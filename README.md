# code-cafe
The Code Café is a series of low key, relaxed meetups where we explore various technologies, tools, programming aids and other fun stuff in a relaxed setting. This repository contains artifacts for the Code Café sessions.

Note: in the Code Café, we can work with various technologies - browser based or local (typically in containers) - and across the stack: UI, (micro)service, database, code editing and programming utilities and general productivity boosters. 

Code Café sessions will usually not work with slides and presentations. Items are introduced with a brief introduction and a demonstration - followed by trying out!
