# Katacoda

TL;DR;
Learn new technologies using real environments - right in your browser. Katacoda is an online platform that offers hundreds of scenarios and sandbox environments to learn about and play with different kinds of technologies. Katacoda is special in that it not only offers the handson instructions - it also provides the runtime environment in which these steps can be executed instantly. Examples of such environments: Linux server, Docker engine, Kubernetes cluster and almost anything that can be run as container. 

Some of the technologies for which Katacoda has scenarios and playground environments - but this is list is by no means exhaustive:
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* Prometheus
* Linux
* Machine Learning
* .NET (on Linux)
* Git
* Consul
* Istio

When you want to learn about a technology, one of the easiest way to get started frequently is a Katacoda scenario - not least of all because it comes with a ready to play environment, right in your browser.

### Custom Scenarios
Katacoda users can also make use of the Katacoda platform to create their own scenarios. The workshop assignments that we create for Code Cafe or SIG sessions could in many cases be created as Katacoda scenario that we could work through in our browser. No local installation, no time lost with configuration issues etc. And free.


## Try out Scenarios and Playgrounds
To get acquainted with Katacoda, let's try out some of the scenarios.

You could try the Katacoda Scenario for Traefik - Load Balance Containers using Traefik:  [https://www.katacoda.com/courses/traefik/deploy-load-balancer] - this corresponds largely with the Code Cafe handson exercise described [here](https://github.com/AMIS-Services/code-cafe/tree/master/traefik).

Some nice other options: 
* A 17-scenario [course on Kubernetes](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)
* A 10-step [course on Git](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)
* [Building and Running MySQL on Docker](https://www.katacoda.com/deepaksks/scenarios/1)
* [Get going with MongoDB](https://www.katacoda.com/oshany/scenarios/mongodb)
* [First steps with Ansible](https://www.katacoda.com/jonatanblue/scenarios/1)

Try out one of the Playgrounds at [Playgrounds](https://www.katacoda.com/search?q=playground&hPP=12&idx=scenarios&p=0&is_v=1) - for example Ubuntu, OpenShift, Kubernetes, Ansible, Node, PHP, ASP.NET Core


## Create a Custom Scenario
In addition to walking through an existing scenario or playing with a technology in a Playground, you can also create your own scenario - for others to walk through. This is a great way to teach a certain tool, technology component or feature to others. 

In order to create a custom Katacoda scenario, you have to sign up for the platform, for example using a GitHub account, at: [sign up](https://www.katacoda.com/signup).

Once signed up and signed in, you can go to [create scenario](https://www.katacoda.com/create) to create a scenario or edit one you have already started work on.

Katacoda has recently started to offer a [CLI tool](https://www.katacoda.com/cli) which which you can "Create and manage courses and scenario from the command-line".

Documentation on how to create a scenario can be found [here](https://www.katacoda.com/docs).
