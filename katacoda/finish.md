# Wow! Well Done!

You have seen Traefik in action - as edge router and load balancer, able to dynamically adapt to new containers and additional container instances.

There is much more to discover.

### Other fun topics
* Health Checks
* Circuit Breaking (take a badly performing backend server out of the pool)
* Header Manipulation
* Timeout
* IP White Listing
* Canary Release (using load balancing with uneven weights for new release end point vs existing release)
* Throttling (rate limiting)
