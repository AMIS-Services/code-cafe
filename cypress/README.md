# Cypress.io

In order to deploy an app to production with confidence, automated testing is a necissity.
Using browser-based intregration testing has some major advantages:

- unit tests / snapshot tests for front end often tend implementation over functionality
- large amounts of code are hit with small amounts of testing

## Getting started

demo:

- cd into koa
- `yarn start`
- `yarn seed`
- cd into react
- `yarn start`
- new terminal window, same path
- `yarn cypress`

## Features

- open source
- fast
- easy to write and debug
- built for responsiveness testing
- spies, stubs, clocks
- direct manipulation of data management solutions (e.g. redux)
- screenshots and video of failing tests
