# Lastpass Password Manager

## Install and Sign-up/Sign-in

First thing you do is install the Lastpass extensions. I've provided the URL to either [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=nl) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/). Although you can use only the web interface of Lastpass, I found using the extensions much easier. After the installation a grey icon with three dots in it will appear on the right side next to the adressbar.

Click on the icon. A pop-up appears from which you can either log in or create a user account. Go ahead and create your user account or log in if you already have one. When logged in your "vault" will open. The vault is where all your accounts are stored. In the Vault paragraph I will explain what the vault is and show its possibilities.

### Vault

All sites are stored in what's called the `Vault`. By default sites aren't stored in a folder. It is possible to create folders and organize sites in folders. You can see the credentials and more information when you click on a site in the Vault. It is also possible to create form-fills and to do a `Security Challenge`. Those possibilities will be explained in the Optional paragraph.

## Add a website

Although you can add website manually to your vault. The easiest option is to add the websites with the extension. To do this you go to a website and enter the credentials on that website. When you login Lastpass will ask you if you want to add the account to your Vault. Click `add` and the website is added.

## Login with Lastpass

When you added a website go to the login page of the website. The Lastpass icon in the toolbar shows a number which lets you now how many accounts Lastpass has on this URL. By default Lastpass autofills you're login credentials. This setting can be disabled (see [edit sites](#edit-sites)). Inside the input fields the Lastpass icon appears as well. If you click on it you get the option to fill in your credentials or edit.

## Generate Password

Lastpass gives you the option to generate passwords as well. Click on the Lastpass icon you'll see the option `Generate Secure Password`. When you are generating password you have some options. Those are:

- Length
- Uppercase and lowercase
- Numbers
- Special Characters
- Pronounceable

You can use up to 100 characters in length. You have basic options like uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. Besides those options you have also the option to make your password pronounceable. It generates a password which supposedly should be easier to pronounce thus easier to remember. When using this option you can't use numbers or special characters.

Click on `Use password` to use it on the current website or click on `Copy Password` to copy it.

## Optional

Lastpass has more features which you can use. These you can try these out if you are interested or if you are done with the rest.

### Forms

When you have to fill in forms most of the time you are fill in same information over and over again like name, address, emailadress, hometown, birthday and more. With forms you have the possibility to enter this kind of information with Lastpass. In the menu on the leftside you see the option Form Fills. Press the plus sign if there ain't a form that already exists. You can create a form with all the information you automatically want to be filled in by Lastpass.

Besides name, age and hometown, you can also enter you more private information like creditcard information or bank information. I personally don't have this information filled in except for name and surname, but it's up to you if you want.

To use the form you go to a website where can enter this kind of information. The website [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) for example. When you try to login you have also the option to join now. This information can automatically be filled in.

### Edit Sites

You can also edit a website. This means you can change the name, URL, username, password and folder. You have also advanced settings. This give you the possibility to use reprompt, auto-login and disable the auto-fill.

- Reprompt: You must enter your master password before you enter your credentials as an extra security layer. Not only for entering the credentials but also when you want to edit some information.
- Auto-login: You'll automatically login with your credentials when accessing the website.
- Auto-fill: automatically enters your credentials when you are on the login page.

### Security Challenge

The security challenge is a challenge on how secure your passwords are. You get three scores:

- Your Security Score: This is a combined rating of how strong your passwords generally are, meaning their overall length and complexity, with the highest possible score being 100 points.

- Your Lastpass Standing: This compares your scores against all other LastPass users who have run the Security Challenge. You are placed in a percentile according to your current security score. The lower the percentage, the better your ranking.

- Master Password: This rates how strong your Master Password is based on length and complexity.

After this score you see an overview with steps on how to improve your score. This is split up in four steps:

1. Change compromised passwords
2. Change weak passwords
3. Change reused passwords
4. Change old passwords

You also see a detailed overview with all you passwords and how strong they are. Here you can also filter passwords out based on one of the four steps.
