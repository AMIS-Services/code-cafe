Workflow choreography, rather than orchestration, and events for data exchange, rather than synchronous interactions, are key to implementing workflows in a robust, flexible, and scalable way that can deal with horizontal and stateless and even serverless scalability and continuous, flexible upgrades. Generic capabilities are introduced for monitoring, workflow instance recovery, scheduling, human notifications, and routing slip management.

Using the other IDEs out there requires a significant learning curve and makes you spend too much time doing technical support for the IDE.

Along the way, you will find out how Apache works, how to download the source code and hack it, and how to return the code back as a submission. There are highs, lows, tears, and lots to learn along the way. At the end, you will hopefully be inspired to go out and fix your own tools.",

Although it offers many benefits, this movement has also introduced challenges—namely how to enable fast, secure communication across microservices. One solution to container networking for polyglot microservices is the sidecar model, in which a separate process that manages all network traffic is deployed alongside your microservice. This session explores the benefits of sidecars and shows how they are implemented through two open source projects: Envoy and Istio. By examining how these technologies could be used in both Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, users will be introduced to the true potential of sidecars.",

The cost of admission, should you wish to pay, is a sample of your favorite bad code that all the participants can marvel at. Really, the presenter wants you to send him your masterpiece or he’ll collect your code at the door.",

		"abstract": "On November 11, 2017, Alibaba smashed its own online transaction record once again. The peak throughput, 325,000 transactions per second, was 85% more than that in 2016. Most of these business-critical transactions are handled by hundreds of thousands of Java applications. The company has customized OpenJDK since 2011 to run its Java applications on more than 100,000 servers. The Alibaba JVM team focuses particularly on ways to innovate JVM technology, including GC, compiler, and runtime, to fulfill its web-scale requirements. This session describes how characterization of its Java workloads would guide the team to implement these features. Although your workloads are different, the thought process the team members have gone through could be useful for you too.   ",

Failing to (re)design our systems to leverage fully reactive data storage and retrieval can both increase complexity <i>and</i> degrade performance. Using Spring Data and your favorite NoSQL data store, you can exploit the full power of reactive systems, all the way to the metal. This session discusses and compares reactive support for MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis and then demonstrates how to put each of them into production by live-coding real-world examples.

		"title": "Adventures with Reactive Streams",
		"abstract": "In today's world, more and more people are creating software that is expected to run at large scale. Large scale and cost-effectiveness often lead programmers to asynchronous programming models for handling vertical scalability concerns. Creating an asynchronous application on the JVM is nontrivial and often leads to disparate abstractions. Reactive Streams is one such abstraction that is widely accepted on the JVM today. This presentation is a deep dive into what it takes to implement the Reactive Streams specifications. It delves into various trade-offs that library developers have to consider while implementing Reactive Streams and which aspects of practical applications make such trade-offs easier.",

Yesterday It changed the way monolithic applications were developed, by adding a consistent and powerful programming model to Java EE and its heir, Jakarta EE. Today CDI is the heart of the MicroProfile specification, providing a seamless and elegant approach to extend the platform. And tomorrow? Thanks to CDI 2.0 and its Java SE support, we can now imagine using JPMS (Jigsaw) to create standalone jlink images containing a MicroProfile microservice. This session takes a quick look at Red Hat’s MicroProfile implementation, Thorntail, and shows the required steps and tools to transform a standard Thorntail deployment to a jlink image for Java 11.",

This hands-on lab explores what microservices mean within the relatively well-established context of SOA, when they make sense, and how to develop them with the Java EE programming model. It examines microservices step by step, using a simple but representative Java EE–based example. The lab starts with a vanilla Java EE monolithic application; breaks down the application into sensible Java EE–based microservices; and applies concepts such as fat JARs, dynamic discovery, and client-side fault tolerance and circuit breakers to the microservices, using WildFly Swarm. If time permits, the microservices will be deployed to Oracle Cloud with Docker.\n<br><br><b>Please review the document <a href=\"https://static.rainfocus.com/oracle/oow18/static/staticFile/static_file/HOL4766%20lab%20setup_1537189680314001PSCt.pdf\">here</a> in preparation for the lab.</b>",

He also presents a survey of serverless options in the Java ecosystem to give you an idea of what is currently available. And of course, participants will dive in with some coding, so bring your laptop. Patel describes what to expect: “We’ll write a serverless Java application and do a local deployment and (time permitting) a cloud deployment while writing unit tests and invocation code. If you have never done any serverless computing, this is your opportunity to fully understand this model for rapid construction and deployment of applications and services.”",

For brands, adapting quickly to skyrocketing expectations translates to greater lifetime customer value and business success. Yet most companies are blocked from meeting customer expectations due to internal siloes of data trapped in marketing, sales, service, and commerce systems. A next-generation approach to customer experience starts with a unified view of the customer, and real-time, AI-driven insights powering relevant interactions on any channel—chatbot, field sales, social ad, or WhatsApp conversation. In this session learn about these topics and how Oracle CX helps organizations build continual customer relationships.",

		"abstract": "Two great features (among others) in MySQL 8.0 are the complete removal of *.frm files from the data dictionary and the ability to create a tablespace and assign a group of tables (originally introduced in 5.7). These features can significantly improve MySQL performance in multitenant environments in the cloud (typical SaaS applications). In those environments, a typical architecture includes creating a schema per customer. This approach improves security (customer data is separated from all other customer data) and flexibility (each customer can have customized application). However, it also means needing to store millions of tables in MySQL. In this session, learn how to solve this challenge in MySQL 8.0.",

The basic idea is simple: when data in the database changes, any clients viewing the data should see the changes immediately: in real time. Gmail and Twitter are great examples of applications that use real-time data. Users don’t need to refresh the page to see new emails or tweets. Instead, new data is pushed to the clients when it becomes available. In this session learn about some of the tools that make real-time applications easier than ever before, including Node.js and Socket.IO. Of course, the data must be pushed from somewhere, so the session also explores the way that Oracle Database participates in this process.",

For instance, it is vital to identify paths in the conversation flow that lead to user abandonment and evaluate reasons for this behavior. While business users require the ability to measure engagement and utilization metrics, developers need to troubleshoot issues to understand what works (or doesn’t) in order to improve accuracy of the chatbot and craft a better user experience as a result. Attend this session to learn how you can accurately gather all of these insights in real time to drive remedial improvements in your digital assistant.",

Gmail and Twitter are great examples of applications that use real-time data. Users don’t need to refresh the page to see new emails or tweets. Instead, new data is pushed to the clients when it becomes available.

The carefully designed API contract brings minimum coupling between modules, letting the two teams work independently. In particular, each can fix its bugs without talking to the other. This session shows you how to use edition-based redefinition to fix bugs in the hard-shell implementation with zero downtime, and flip end-user sessions to the patched version from inside the database. Only SmartDB can implement the flip for every server call.",

Instead, new data is pushed to the clients when it becomes available.

For instance, it is vital to identify paths in the conversation flow that lead to user abandonment and evaluate reasons for this behavior. While business users require the ability to measure engagement and utilization metrics, developers need to troubleshoot issues to understand what works (or doesn’t) in order to improve accuracy of the chatbot and craft a better user experience as a result.

Instead, new data is pushed to the clients when it becomes available.
